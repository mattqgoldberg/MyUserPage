# Matt's User Page
Hi, my name is Matt and this is a page all about me!
## The Basics
I am a second year student at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). I am a Computer Engineering major in Warren College. I was born in Colorado, but I've lived in Orange County since I was 3. 
## Sports
I played soccer and ~~base~~teeball as a kid, then played tennis in high school. My favorite sport to watch is definitely American football. I am a **huge** LA Chargers fan excited to go to all the home games next season!
## Music
I listen to all kinds of music but Hip-Hop is my favorite in general. I also love 70s, 80s, etc.

### My Top 3 Hip-Hop Artists:

1. ***Kanye West***

# Programming
I have been programming in some form since maybe 5th grade. I was taught block coding in school and really liked it. I made some simple games in high school and want to get more into game programming.

## A quote that I like.

> Assembly is like writing a cooking recipe by telling the reader to move their individual muscles

## A Dilemma

I can't decide if I like 
```
def func() {
  #some code
}
```
or 
```
def func()
{
  #some code
}
```
I feel like I am leaning toward to former but who knows.
